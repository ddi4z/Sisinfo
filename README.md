## 📄 Important Note

The **Sisinfo** source code is **confidential** and cannot be shared publicly.  
However, the project is thoroughly documented in the original thesis, which **is** publicly accessible:

📖 You can consult the thesis here → [Thesis in the Uniandes Repository](https://repositorio.uniandes.edu.co/entities/publication/7d6afa04-d473-4783-8721-2c973d29764b)

📖 You can watch the demo here → [Demo](Sisinfo-demo.mp4)

> Currently, the thesis is **under development by a new team of students**, who are working on deployment, bug fixing, and improving some functionalities.

## 🚀 Technologies

Sisinfo was developed using:

-   **Next.js**: React framework for modern applications with hybrid rendering.
-   **shadcn**: Accessible and customizable UI components.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid design.
-   **Zustand**: Lightweight global state management.
-   **TanStack Query**: Server data fetching and synchronization.
-   **Nest.js**: REST server.
-   **Docker**: Database orchestration in development.
-   **Turborepo**: Monorepo management tool.
-   **npm/yarn**: Package managers.

## 🧪 Testing

Different types of tests were configured during development to ensure software quality:

-   **Unit tests** (`npm run test`)
-   **Coverage tests** (`npm run test:cov`)
-   **End-to-end tests** (`npm run test:e2e`)
-   **Monkeys testing** with Playwright  
    (`npx playwright test 'gremlins.test.js'`)
